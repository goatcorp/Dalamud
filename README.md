Dalamud is a plugin development framework for FFXIV that provides access to game data and native interoperability with the game itself to add functionality and quality-of-life.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher), which manages and launches Dalamud for you. __It is generally not recommended for end users to try to run Dalamud manually as XIVLauncher manages multiple required dependencies.__

## Hold Up!

If you are just trying to **use** Dalamud, you don't need to do anything on this page - please [download XIVLauncher](https://goatcorp.github.io/) from its official page and follow the setup instructions.

## Building and testing locally

Please check the [docs page on building Dalamud](https://dalamud.dev/building) for more information and required dependencies.

## Plugin development
Dalamud features a growing API for in-game plugin development with game data and chat access and overlays.
Please see our [Developer FAQ](https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/development) and the [API documentation](https://dalamud.dev) for more details.

If you need any support regarding the API or usage of Dalamud, please [join our discord server](https://discord.gg/3NMcUV5).
