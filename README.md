Dalamud is a plugin development framework for FINAL FANTASY XIV that provides access to game data and native interoperability with the game itself to add functionality and quality-of-life.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

## Plugin development
Dalamud features a growing API for in-game plugin development with game data and chat access and overlays.
