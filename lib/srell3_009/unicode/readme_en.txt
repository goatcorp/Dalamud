1. ucfdataout2.cpp

  This is a C++ source file for a program that generates a newer version
of srell_ucfdata2.hpp, which is a C++ source file that SRELL 2.500- includes
for case-folding. It is generated by ucfdataout with CaseFolding.txt provided
by the Unicode Consortium.

  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | What is CaseFolding.txt?
  |
  |   It is a data file needed for case-insensitive matching based on the
  | Unicode Standard. Whenever a new version of the Unicode Standard is
  | released, CaseFolding.txt may also be updated accordingly.
  |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1-1. Usage

    1) compile ucfdataout2.cpp,
    2) get the latest version of CaseFolding.txt, which is available at
       http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/CaseFolding.txt ,
    3) put CaseFolding.txt and a binary file generated at 1) in the same
       directory and run the binary file,
    4) move the newly generated "srell_ucfdata2.hpp" to the directory in where
       SRELL is put.

  1-2. Compatibility

    srell_ucfdata2.hpp is not compatible with srell_ucfdata.hpp that SRELL up
    to 2.401 was using.

2. updataout.cpp

  This is a C++ source file for a program that generates a newer version
of srell_updata.hpp, which is a C++ source file that SRELL includes for
the Unicode property escapes (\p{...} and \P{...}). It is generated by
updataout with the following text files provided by the Unicode Consortium:

  * DerivedCoreProperties.txt
  * DerivedNormalizationProps.txt
  * emoji-data.txt
  * PropList.txt
  * ScriptExtensions.txt
  * Scripts.txt
  * UnicodeData.txt

  As well as CaseFolding.txt mentioned above, these files may be updated
accordingly whenever a new version of the Unicode Standard is released.

  2-1. Usage

    1) compile updataout.cpp,
    2) get the latest versions of the text files mentioned above, which are
       available at:
       a. emoji-data.txt: http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/emoji/
       b. others: http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/ ,
    3) put the text files and a binary file generated at 1) in the same
       directory and run the binary file,
    4) move the newly generated "srell_updata.hpp" to the directory in where
       SRELL is put.

  Note: emoji-data.txt has been moved from /Public/UNIDATA/ to
        /Public/emoji/(version number)/ since Unicode 11.0.0.
        Since Unicode 13.0.0, moved to /Public/UNIDATA/emoji/ .

  2-2. Compatibility

    srell_updata.hpp does not have compatibility issues as of this release.
